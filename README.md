This is my attempt to fine-tune a stable diffusion model for my own dataset â€” my face. I used the pretrained model from https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2. I only used 10 images for this activity; it can also work with 6, but 10 images provided better results. The following results are from my version 4 of **fast-DreamBooth.ipynb**. Please ignore fast-DreamBooth_5.ipynb for now.

**Results:**
Here are screenshots of the faces generated. According to my friends, my model correctly captured my glasses, nose, and side mustache. However, my facial shape is not quite there; it appears a little too chubby.

These two images looks like me inside a laboratory class. The shape of my face is really not there yet.

**These three are by far, the closest to my actual face:**

For the record, here are my training images. My caption for all the images is just "Jem", my nickname.

One reason why the shape of my face is _not there_ can perhaps be attributed to my training images. All of them are too different. In my version 5, I actually took 30 selfies with minimal pose changes and consistent background. It actually got my face correct but the skin tone is not there.
