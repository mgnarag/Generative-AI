This is my attempt to fine tune stable diffusion model for my own dataset - my face. I used the pretrained model from https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2. I only used 10 images for this activity, it can also work for 6 image but 10 images provided better result. 
The following results are from my version 4 of **fast-DreamBooth.ipynb**. Please ignore fast-DreamBooth_5.ipynb.
